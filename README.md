## git_acp

git_acp is abash script that combines` git add .`, `git commit -m <message>` and git push all in one. `git add .` adds all changes in the working repository as  denoted by `.`. `git commit` then prompts for a commit message.

- Use
`./git_acp`

## file_writer.py

file_writer.py is a template for writing c code using python. It takes code written in c and generates a c file. I use it to remove the hustle of copy pating code repeatedly. It can take several scripts and generate several files. 

NOTE

All files containig `\` must be added and extra `\` for python to correctly write the c file.
